# SQL Driven Machine Learning Tutorial: Customer Churn Prediction

In this tutorial, we will walk through an example of using SQL-driven machine learning to predict customer churn. We will be using the JupySQL package to run SQL queries within a Jupyter Notebook and a public dataset available on Kaggle.

Table of Content:
1. Introduction of the problem, use case, and background story. 
2. Introduction to JupySQL and the dataset.
3. EDA + fitting the model 
4. Generating a stakeholder report
5. Questions and Answers

Prerequisites
- Install and run a Jupyter Lab instance
- Install the JupySQL package using pip:
You can run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Once that's done, you can run the jupyter lab using this command (make sure you're in the main directory):

`jupyter lab`

Once you have the jupyter running, please open `odsc.ipynb` (you can double click it).
